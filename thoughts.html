        <h3>On Biomimicry & Swarm intelligence</h3>
        <p>
            Humans mimic nature for technological breakthroughs like velcro from Burdock plants and neural networks from brains. Swarm intelligence—seen in fish schools and bird flocks—particularly fascinates me. AI agents could leverage this phenomenon, creating systems where independent agents follow simple rules but produce complex, adaptive behaviors through their interactions, solving problems that centralized systems cannot.

        <h3>On search engines</h3>
        <p>
            Search engines rule our digital world. They've made information instant, forcing businesses, education, and emotions to optimize for algorithms. These ranking systems have quietly reshaped society. But do algorithms have empathy? Can small businesses truly compete with corporations for visibility? But perhaps seeking empathy from mathematical formulas reveals our deep discomfort with how impersonal forces now determine success and visibility in our world.

        <h3>On Career</h3>
        <p>
            The common advice of people telling you to do what you love is very flawed. What if I don't love work or anything else that people would pay me for?
        </p>
        <p>
            People giving advice have to face no consequence when your career of doing things you love fails.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll refrain from giving out unsolicited advice. The only thing I encourage you to do- is do things. Build things, go outside, live your life.
            Maybe you'll find your calling. Or maybe you'll have a lot of stories.

        <h3>On returns</h3>
        <p>
            We buy things online and consequently sometimes don't like them and return them.
            In the fashion industry, this often stems from limited information available to guide purchasing decisions—such as unclear sizing (which virtual try-on technology aims to address), lack of transparency around materials, and the common issue of buyer's remorse.
        </p>
        <p>
            While it's impossible to completely eliminate returns—and doing so could even be detrimental to the consumer—there's a crucial need to develop tools and platforms that promote smarter, more informed purchasing decisions.

        <h3>On Image Gen AI and frustrations as a consumer</h3>
        <p>
            Recently I've noticed platforms like instagram and facebook have introduced Image generation capabilities on their platform. As a user, I have only ever accidentally clicked on them and haven't been able to make sense of these features. They all fundamentally seem to fit into the category of solutions looking for problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            A couple of great ideas worth pursuing using image-gen are:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Image editing/iteration with greater adherence</li>
            <li>Search for when you quite can't find references (think childhood toy, dream dress etc)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>On the future of games</h3>
        <p>
            I spend a good amount of my time playing games. While I genuinely love the actual gameplay, I believe I return most often for my friends. Recently, I've been intrigued by the concept of gaming companions—AI entities that converse, behave, and build relationships like true friends would. Though this idea borders on dystopian territory, we shouldn't overlook its potential value for those with limited access to social interaction in their daily lives.

        <h3>On gatekept technologies</h3>
        <p>
            Checking AI platform pricing in India during my recent trip home was disappointing. Besides Google, most lacked country-specific offerings. While the business challenges of regional pricing are understandable, it's troubling that a significant portion of the global population without international payment methods can't access these technologies. The world misses out on innovations these diverse perspectives could create.

    <div class="blog-post">
        <h3>On Sources of data</h3>
        <p>
            Search engines flaunting unvetted sources is like a restaurant bragging about its menu transparency while quietly sourcing shrimp from a dumpster. Fine for cat videos, risky for news or shopping. Instead of trust-falling into the entire internet, there's a need to build niche tools that get their data from a smaller, more manageable set of sources.
