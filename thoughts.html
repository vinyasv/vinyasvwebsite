        <h3>On search engines</h3>
        <p>
            The world's most popular product is a search engine. Search engines have made access to information effortless.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are the holders of true power- businesses, textbooks and feelings all need to be SEO optimized.
            Search result ranking has ultimately shaped society in ways we don't realize.
        </p>
        <p>
            This made me question- do ranking algorithms have empathy? Can mom & pop corner stores compete with large corporations to rank higher?
        </p>

        <h3>On returns</h3>
        <p>
            We buy things online and consequently sometimes don't like them and return them.
            In the fashion industry, this can be attributed to the lack of information informing the purchase decisions-
            think sizing (Virtual try on trying to solve this), materials (Not all Companies are transparent) and buyer's remorse.
        </p>
        <p>
            While ultimately eliminating returns is impossible and a loss for the consumer- there is a very important need to build tools
            and platforms that encourage better more informed purchase decisions.
        </p>

        <h3>On Advice</h3>
        <p>
            People tend to ask others for free advice. For the advisor it's often a way to put their thoughts out on a situation without any real consequence.
