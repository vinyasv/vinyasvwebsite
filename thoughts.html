        <h3>On search engines</h3>
        <p>
            The world's most popular product is a search engine. Search engines have made access to information effortless.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are the holders of true power- businesses, textbooks and feelings all need to be SEO optimized.
            Search result ranking has ultimately shaped society in ways we don't realize.
        </p>
        <p>
            This made me question- do ranking algorithms have empathy? Can mom & pop corner stores compete with large corporations to rank higher?
        </p>

        <h3>On returns</h3>
        <p>
            We buy things online and consequently sometimes don't like them and return them.
            In the fashion industry, this can be attributed to the lack of information informing the purchase decisions-
            think sizing (Virtual try on trying to solve this), materials (Not all Companies are transparent) and buyer's remorse.
        </p>
        <p>
            While ultimately eliminating returns is impossible and a loss for the consumer- there is a very important need to build tools
            and platforms that encourage better more informed purchase decisions.
        </p>

        <h3>On Career</h3>
        <p>
            The common advice of people telling you to do what you love is very flawed. What if I don't love work or anything else that people would pay me for?
        </p>
        <p>
            People giving advice have to face no consequence when your career of doing things you love fails.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll refrain from giving out unsolicited advice. The only thing I encourage you to do- is do things. Build things, go outside, live your life.
            Maybe you'll find your calling. Or maybe you'll have a lot of stories.
