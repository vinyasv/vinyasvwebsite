    <div>
        <h3><a href="https://getmatchymatchy.com" target="_blank">Matchy Matchy</a></h3>
        <p>
            Matchy Matchy is an e-commerce search engine built to help people find product alternatives from trusted retailers.
            The goal behind this project is to encourage people to make better purchase decisions for themselves and for the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            From a technical perspective, our advantage is our focus on e-commerce and our smaller more curated index.
        </p>
        <p>
            I architected and built the entire product.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h3><a href="https://obsessar.com" target="_blank">Obsess</a></h3>
        <p>
            Obsess is an experiential e-commerce platform. The company was recently acquired for $25M by Infinite Reality.
            I worked as a Senior Product Manager on their e-commerce platform. I lead the 0-1 development of the platform,
            which played a key role in the acquisition.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h3>Mydocc</h3>
        <p>
            Mydocc was a primarily academic project I worked on while at Grad school. We used a computer vision model to digitize healthcare records in India.
            The project ultimately ran into data compliance issues and was never fully commercialized/launched.
        </p>
        <p>
            I however, learnt how to do product things- talk to users, work with engineers, design the user experience and design the system architecture.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h3><a href="https://unsenttexts.com/" target="_blank">unsent texts</a></h3>
        <p>
            An experimental art website exploring the vulnerability felt when unsending a typed message.
