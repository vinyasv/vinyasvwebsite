        <p>
            Mydocc was a primarily academic project I worked on while at Grad school. We used a computer vision model to digitize healthcare records in India.
            The project ultimately ran into data compliance issues and was never fully commercialized/launched.
        </p>
        <p>
            I however, learnt how to do product things- talk to users, work with engineers, design the user experience and design the system architecture.

        <p>
            A system based on the recent Anthropic paper on the same topic that improves accuracy of RAG agents. Adds "context" to every piece of chunked data for more accurate retrieval. Built the functionality to ingest a piece of data, chunk the said data, add context to each of the chunks and embeds it into a vector a database.
